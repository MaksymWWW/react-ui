# @reach/auto-id

Deterministic auto element IDs for WAI-ARIA. Some ARAI APIs link components together via DOM IDs. Creating IDs manually is not really a normal part of React development, so Reach UI generates IDs for you.

If you are not server rendering, then you do not need this package. Enjoy your day!

If you are server rendering, you will need to wrap your entire app in the `AutoIdProvider`.

```jsx
import { AutoIdProvider } from "@reach/auto-id"

ReactDOM.render(
  <AutoIdProvider>
    <App />
  </AutoIdProvider>,
  root
)
```

And now the auto-generated IDs will be the same in the server and client renders.

## `useId`

If you are building something and want to generate IDs automatically, you can `useId()` the same way the Reach UI components do:

```.jsx
(() => {
  function Example() {
    const [now, setNow] = useState(Date.now());
    const id = useId();
    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={() => setNow(Date.now())}>click me!</button>
        <p>ID is the same every render: {id}</p>
        <p>{now}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }

  return <Example />;
})();
```
